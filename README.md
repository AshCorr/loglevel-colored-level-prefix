## The problem

[`loglevel`][loglevel] is great, and I find that I often want the log output to
be formatted the same way every time. Also I don't really like some of the
implementation of `loglevel` (specifically the fact that it uses some browser
APIs for some things.

## This solution

This exposes a function to get a logger (singleton) with colored prefixes for
the level. Note that this only works in Node because it uses [`chalk`][chalk].

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save loglevel-colored-level-prefix
```

## Usage

```javascript
const getLogger = require('loglevel-colored-level-prefix')
const options = {prefix: 'your-prefix', level: 'trace'}
const logger = getLogger(options)
logger.trace('WOW! What the stack trace!?')
// Trace: your-prefix [TRACE]: WOW! What the stack trace!?
//     at Logger.trace (<full-path>/node_modules/loglevel-colored-level-prefix/dist/index.js:54:24)
//     at ... etc
logger.debug('sup debug?')
// your-prefix [DEBUG]: sup debug?
logger.info('Hey info')
// your-prefix [INFO]: Hey info
logger.warn('Hi warn')
// your-prefix [WARN]: Hi warn
logger.error('Hello error')
// your-prefix [ERROR]: Hello error
```

Let's look at what that actually looks like...

### options

#### prefix

**?String** - Whatever you want your prefix to be. Normally this is the tool
that you're logging for. The `getLogger` function will return the same instance
of the logger based on the given prefix.

#### level

**?String** - What you want the initial level to be set to. This defaults to:
`process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'warn'`. Possible options are (in order of verbosity):
`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.

### returns

An instance of a `loglevel` logger. Learn more about that API from the
[`loglevel` docs][loglevel].

## Inspiration

I wrote this because I wanted to use the plugin I created for
[`prettier-eslint`][prettier-eslint] in
[`prettier-eslint-cli`][prettier-eslint-cli]. And I'll probably use it in other
projects/tools as well.

## Other Solutions

I'm unaware of other plugins for `loglevel` that do what this one does. But
there are _many_ logging solutions out there...
